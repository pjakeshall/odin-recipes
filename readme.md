The current project is meant to display understanding
of the basics of HTML, and basics of git commits.
To display this, the website (HTML) will be displaying headers, paragraphs, lists, images, and links.

After doing this project, I feel much more confident in my basics in Git and HTML. Actually making something even as basic as these recipe pages helped put everything learned up to this point in action. I had almost no issues utilizing everything taught, and am mostly satisfied with my pages made.
